# Story 4: Contributor Compliance History Visualization

**Epic:** Epic 3 - Compliance Monitoring & Predictive Alerts System  
**Fecha:** 2025-08-15  
**Versión:** 1.0  
**Tipo:** Brownfield Feature Addition  
**Prioridad:** ⚡ Alta  
**Estimación:** M (1-3 días)  
**Estado:** ✅ Ready for Review

## User Story

**As a** compliance manager,  
**I want** to view the complete compliance history of an individual contributor with timeline visualization and trend analysis,  
**So that** I can understand historical compliance patterns, identify recurring issues, and make informed decisions about risk assessment and support strategies.

## Technical Implementation Details

### Integration Points

### Technical Specifications

#### Component Architecture
```jsx
// ComplianceHistoryView.jsx - Main container
const ComplianceHistoryView = ({ cuit, onClose }) => {
  // Manages state, API calls, and child component coordination
  // Integrates ComplianceTimeline, ComplianceTrends, CompliancePatterns
}

// ComplianceTimeline.jsx - Timeline visualization  
const ComplianceTimeline = ({ events, onEventSelect, filters }) => {
  // D3.js or similar for timeline rendering
  // Event filtering and pagination
}

// ComplianceTrends.jsx - Historical trend charts
const ComplianceTrends = ({ trendData, timeRange }) => {
  // Chart.js or D3.js for trend visualization
  // Risk score evolution, compliance status trends
}

// CompliancePatterns.jsx - Pattern analysis
const CompliancePatterns = ({ patternData, cuit }) => {
  // Statistical analysis display
  // Recurring issues, seasonal patterns
}
```

#### API Response Format
```json
// GET /api/compliance/history/{cuit}
{
  "cuit": "20123456789",
  "totalEvents": 245,
  "page": 1,
  "pageSize": 50,
  "events": [
    {
      "id": "evt_001",
      "type": "alert",
      "severity": "warning",
      "title": "Vencimiento próximo",
      "description": "IVA vence en 3 días",
      "timestamp": "2025-08-12T10:30:00Z",
      "riskScore": 6.5,
      "metadata": { "alertType": "deadline", "daysUntilDue": 3 }
    }
  ],
  "summary": {
    "currentRiskScore": 4.2,
    "avgRiskScore": 5.1,
    "totalAlerts": 12,
    "complianceRate": 94.5
  }
}
```

#### Database Query Patterns
```sql
-- Historical events with pagination
SELECT * FROM (
  SELECT 'alert' as type, created_at as timestamp, severity, message as title, 
         alert_type as subtype FROM compliance_alerts WHERE cuit = ?
  UNION ALL
  SELECT 'status_change' as type, updated_at as timestamp, status as severity, 
         'Status changed' as title, status as subtype FROM compliance_monitoring WHERE cuit = ?
) ORDER BY timestamp DESC LIMIT ? OFFSET ?;

-- Risk score trends
SELECT DATE(updated_at) as date, AVG(risk_score) as avg_score, 
       MIN(risk_score) as min_score, MAX(risk_score) as max_score
FROM compliance_monitoring 
WHERE cuit = ? AND updated_at >= ? 
GROUP BY DATE(updated_at) 
ORDER BY date;
```

### Risk Mitigation

#### Performance Risk
**Risk:** Large historical datasets slow contributor details loading  
**Mitigation:** Lazy loading, pagination (50 events/page), Redis caching for frequent queries  
**Fallback:** Disable history view via feature flag

#### Integration Risk  
**Risk:** Changes break existing contributor management  
**Mitigation:** Non-invasive integration via new button, extensive regression testing  
**Fallback:** Remove history button, no database changes required

#### Data Quality Risk
**Risk:** Inconsistent historical data affects trend accuracy  
**Mitigation:** Data validation in APIs, graceful handling of missing data  
**Fallback:** Display available data with appropriate disclaimers

### Definition of Done

- [ ] All acceptance criteria verified through testing
- [ ] Code review completed following Epic 3 standards  
- [ ] Performance benchmarks met (< 2s load, pagination working)
- [ ] Accessibility testing passed (screen reader, keyboard navigation)
- [ ] Documentation updated (API docs, component docs)
- [ ] E2E tests pass including regression tests for existing functionality
- [ ] Feature deployed behind feature flag for safe rollout

## Handoff Notes for Developer

This story extends Epic 3's compliance monitoring system with historical visualization while maintaining full backward compatibility. The implementation follows established patterns from ComplianceDashboard components and reuses existing database schema.

**Key Integration Points:**
- Hook into existing contributor details modal via new "View Compliance History" action
- Reuse compliance_results, compliance_monitoring, compliance_alerts tables
- Follow ComplianceDashboard component patterns for consistency

**Critical Requirements:**
- No changes to existing contributor management functionality
- Performance optimization mandatory due to historical data volume
- Mobile responsiveness required for field compliance managers

**Testing Priority:**
- Regression testing for existing contributor management workflow
- Performance testing with large datasets (1000+ historical events)
- Mobile responsiveness across devices

This story completes the compliance monitoring vision by providing the missing historical perspective for comprehensive contributor compliance analysis.
